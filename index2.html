                                                As you know, Tết is Vietnamese Lunar New Year and the most important festival in

Vietnam. The word is a shortened form of Tết Nguyên Đán, meaning ‘Feast of the First 

Morning of the First Day’. The occasion celebrates the arrival of Spring. It’s a time for 

families to get together and celebrate the beginning of the New Year with renewed 

hope. While Lunar New Year celebrations originated in China and were brought to many 

East Asian countries, Vietnam is the only country that insists on calling it by another 

name, Tết, and in doing so have also made it their own. <br><br>

Tết has traditionally had many key rituals and practices – some tracing their roots back 

to the festival’s Chinese origins, some being uniquely Vietnamese. For a nation of 

farmers attached to the land for thousands of years, it has always been a festival 

marking the communion of man with nature. In the flow of seasons, it is a pause during 

which both the field and farmer enjoy some rest after twelve months of hard work. And 

to this day it is a period of renewal and it’s this idea that defines the customs of Tết.

                                               Families believe that their activities during Tết should involve happiness, joy and good

luck. That's why even before the beginning of Tết, it's customary for families to make 

preparations. Cleaning and painting their home in anticipation of Spring, settling old 

debts or disputes and pledge to behave nicely and work hard in the New Year. <br><br>

Traditionally people also buy new clothes to celebrate the occasion. Paying homage to 

ancestors is another important part of Tết with families praying in Temples, Churches 

and Pagodas. They visit the graves of their relatives and make altars in their homes. 

These have photographs of their ancestors and they offer them symbolic gifts in the 

form of food, flowers and incense. The night before the New Year, families perform a 

ritual where incense sticks are burned to invite the spirits of their ancestors to join them 

in celebration. This is also a time to bid farewell to the family's Kitchen God (Ong Tao), 

who then returns to heaven to report on their behavior in the past year to the Jade 

Emperor. They leave cookies out for Ong Tao to get a favorable report and release 

goldfish in a lake to transport him to heaven.<br><br>

During Tết, houses are decorated with several different things. Cay Neu is a small

bamboo tree planted in the front of the house. Hoa Mai is a yellow blossom that 

represents Spring. Red banners are hung on front doors as it's believed the colour 

prevents evil spirits from entering the house. Adults give fancy red envelopes to children 

full of Li Xi or ‘lucky money’, always in even denominations since odd numbers are 

considered bad luck. <br><br>

When it's time for Le Tru Tich, the official start of Tết, people fill the streets in 

celebration of the New Year. They try to make as much noise as possible using anything 

from firecrackers, drums, bells and gongs, to simple wooden instruments to ward off 

evil spirits. Xong Dat is another important custom for the first day of Tết to ensure good 

luck for the coming year. It's critical that the first person who visits a family's house in 

the New Year is someone who has enjoyed good luck during the previous year. The 

belief is that his or her karma can also influence the family's fortune in the coming year.

                                                Over the years, some of these rituals have stopped or changed due to practical,

economic or environmental circumstances. Now firecrackers are banned and there is 

only the controlled Government fireworks display in HCMC and Hanoi. While families 

got together to make Banh Chung in the past, they often buy these from shops now. 

Almost 30% of the Vietnamese surveyed by FTA in 2013 said that they bought 

everything for Tết from stores. 21% said the traditional preparation activities have all 

but disappeared. But it’s not just changes at a family level. Stores themselves have 

changed their tradition of being shut for the entire period to just the first day of Tết. 

Only one day now then business as usual.<br><br>

These changes have started having an impact on the ‘atmosphere’ of Tết. When we 

spoke to teens, young adults and older generations, they all told us that they feel Tết 

isn’t what it used to be. It has lost its spirit – the magic of the family gathering together , 

preparing together. The heart-warming feeling of everyone being busy and active with 

Tết rituals. Even the stores being shut made Tết holidays unique and special. 32.5% of 

Vietnamese surveyed said Tết no longer had the warm, happy atmosphere as it used to.

“When the stores stayed shut for 2 weeks, we had to prepare enough food for the whole 

time, shopping in advance for everything we’d need. But now they are open after the 

first day, there is nothing we need to do. It just doesn’t feel the same anymore” – <strong>Ngoc, 

27 years, HCMC</strong> <br><br>

What’s more, with more families from cities living abroad and more migration from the 

rural parts to the cities (and the migrants going back to their home towns), Tết in the 

cities like HCMC, Hanoi and Danang is much quieter. In some ways, it has lost its energy 

and vibe. And today, many families are even choosing to use the Tết break as a time to 

go away on holiday to foreign locations.<br><br>

“When we were young, when Tết came, the streets would be crowded and bustling – 

everyone out celebrating together or doing something. Now the streets are so empty, we 

can lie down on the streets. It’s not as fun as it used to be” – <strong>Hanh, 21 years, HCMC</strong><br><br>

In addition to this, Tết has started posing an economic strain on Vietnamese – with 

many families even having to take loans out for the festivities along with the cost of 

going back to hometowns increasing dramatically year on year. There is also a significant 

financial benefit working through Tết instead of taking off to be home with family. These 

economic considerations have become such a significant problem that 1 in 4 

Vietnamese avoid celebrating Tết.

                                                   But even as these sentiments change, Tết still remains a very dear festival to

Vietnamese, young and old alike. When asked if Tết and the Western New Year should 

be merged or if Tết should disappear, Vietnamese were strongly against it. These 

proposals led a controversial debate earlier this year when it was suggested by 

prominent economists. There is a deep-rooted sense that ‘this is ours’, ‘it is a part of our 

culture and our tradition’, ‘if we lose Tết, we will lose a part of who we are’. These were 

the comments we heard when challenging Vietnamese teens and young adults,  

especially heartening when they seem to be the ones who are most ‘bored’ during Tết.

This is what makes Tết a crucial celebration for the Vietnamese even today and for 

marketers the most important season to drive sales volumes. It is therefore critical to 

understand the changing nature of Tết and what it means so as to effectively engage the 

Vietnamese during this important festival. And to play a role in their lives to make Tết 

something to cherish again.<br><br>

Brands that do well during Tết are the ones that understand these dilemmas and help 

resolve them by making Tết more relevant to today’s cultural context. When we look at 

4 of the top 5 brands in Tết 2015, we see that these are brands that have done exactly 

that. Coca Cola, the number 1 brand for the fourth year running, reminded Vietnamese 

about the true meaning of Tết – helping the youth reengage with family and understand 

the importance of time over money. OMO also tapped in to the economic constraints 

imposed by Tết on family reunions. The brand told the story of the young girl who helps 

the old vendor make enough money to afford the increasingly expensive travel costs to 

return home. Neptune tapped into the growing behavior of young families using Tết as a 

holiday to go away to travel, remindeding them of the need to go back home to their 

older generations who were longing to see them. Vinacafe interestingly moved away 

from traditional Tết themes while still focusing on key Tết construct of connecting 

families. They showed that they understood the difficulty by helping youths express 

themselves to their parents. <br><br>

Year after year, we at Phibious have proven we can crack the Tết code. Coke has been 

the number 1 brand for 4 years consecutively. In 2012, we tapped in to the insight of the 

redefined, extended notion of ‘family’ and Coke acted as an enabler to connect with 

larger personal groups bringing the family together. In 2013, we tapped in to the insight 

of blue collar workers needing to work through Tết to make additional income and Coke 

brought the family together by taking Tết to the father who was working as a bus driver 

through Tết. In 2014, we tapped in to the insight that the youth feel bored and 

disconnected during Tết and Coke helped the youth reengage by bringing their own 

twist to Tết chores and helping family reconnect. And finally in 2015, we tapped in to 

the insight on the growing financial pressure on young adults with the expectations of 

expensive gifts, Coke reminding families that it is time with family that is more 

important than the money you spend on family.<br><br>

With our engagements for Coke during Tết, we realized the critical importance of 

understanding the changing cultural scene of Vietnam. But that’s not the whole story. <br><br>

We also realized that it was critical to engage the right protagonists for the brand. We 

needed to understand what the impact of changing means to engagement with media 

for our target. And then produce the most relevant story on the most relevant touch-

points. In 2015, Coke’s brand preference increased significantly (due to confidentiality, 

the actual numbers cannot be revealed). And since our TVC remained the same as the 

previous year, this increase can be unilaterally associated with our film that was shared 

virally online. We encouraged young Vietnamese not to be hindered by the idea of 

buying expensive gifts but to simply go back home for Tết because what really matters 

was time with family. The longer digital format allowed for more detailed, emotional 

storytelling which clearly resonated with audiences. It became the most watched and 

shared video within 24 hours (even beating the Super Bowl teaser films) and had over 

6.5mn views in a 4 weeks.

                                           Tet has always been a time for families to get together. But we found that with time,

especially for the youth and young adults, this notion of family had taken on a much 

more extended meaning to include friends, colleagues, neighbors, etc. We tapped in 

to the insight of the redefined and extended notion of ‘family’ and Coke acted as an 

enabler for connecting with larger personal groups and then bringing the family 

together.

                                           Once again leveraging on the most critical aspect of Tet – family togetherness. We

realized that while in the past everyone took time off to celebrate Tet with their 

family, with the increasing economic demands of today’s Vietnam, many people in 

the lower and middle income brackets chose to work through Tet to earn extra 

money and help provide for their families. This however came in the way of families 

celebrating Tet together. We tapped in to the insight of blue collar workers needing 

to work through Tet to make additional income and Coke brought the family 

together by taking Tet to the father who was working as a bus driver through Tet.

                                           We found that the old Tet traditions had lost its relevance amongst the youth,

making them feel disengaged and as a fall out, disconnected from their family and 

not spending time together. We tapped in to the insight that the youth feel bored 

and disconnected during Tet and Coke helped the youth reengage by bringing their 

own twist to Tet chores and helping family reconnect and bond over doing the 

“refreshed” rituals together.

                                            We found that 1 in 4 young adults were choosing not to go back home to celebrate

Tet with their families because of the growing economic burden on them in terms of 

having to buy expensive gifts to take back home and expenses on Tet celebrations 

once they were there. We tapped in to the insight on the growing economic pressure 

for young adults and Coke reminded families that it is time with family that is more 

important than the money you spend on them.<br><br>

Results:<br><br>

Our stories resonated well with youth, young adults and their families resulting in 

Coca Cola being the #1 brand of Tet for 4 years consecutively according to Millward 

Brown’s post Tet survey. What’s more, we were not just loved but were also 

effective in driving sales year on year with a significant volume growth to show for 

it.
